  In my spare time I have been known to try my hand at many hobbies, robotics,
  coding, electronics, woodworking, graphic design, CAD/modelling for CNC
  production, baking, cooking, gardening, the list is almost endless. Many of
  these various pursuits have led me to the maker movement and its philosophy of
  learning-through-doing or experimentation. This movement inspires thousands of
  people around the globe to give it a go and build something, anything and it
  inspires me to step out of my comfort zone and learn.
