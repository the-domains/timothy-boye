  The eternal student, I am always seeking to acquire new knowledge and skills
  whether in my professional life or in my various hobbies such as woodworking
  and making. In my professional life I have studied preparatory units at The
  University of Sydney, engineering units at Macquarie University and received a
  Bachelor of Information Technology specialising in software development at The
  Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. In my first year of university study
  with Macquarie University I even had the honour of receiving the GT Micropro
  Prize in Computing and the Optus Engineering Scholarship.
