Between 2012 and 2014 I spent some time working for Macquarie University and their LEAP Robotics High School program. During my time with LEAP Robotics I was involved in attending schools in the greater Sydney area to teach the students all about engineering principles and software programming but deeper than that we strived to show them that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) can be interesting and aimed to impart related skills like confidence and leadership.

We do this through a number of mediums: firstly with Lego Mindstorms products to teach the basics of programming and robotics, secondly as part of the FIRST Tech Challenge a competition where students build small robots primarily from similar products to mechano whilst still using the Lego Mindstorms NXT controller and finally as part of the FIRST Robotics Competition where students build large robots from essentially scratch using the more complex National Instruments Compact RIO controller before competing nationally and internationally.
