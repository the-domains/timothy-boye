During my time with LEAP Robotics at Macquarie University I was involved in attending schools in the greater Sydney area to teach the students all about engineering principles and software programming but deeper than that we strived to instil an interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as well as inspire related skills such as confidence and leadership.

We did this through a number of mediums: firstly with Lego Mindstorms to teach the basics of programming and robotics, secondly as part of the FIRST Tech Challenge a competition where students built small robots primarily with mechano-like products and the Lego Mindstorms NXT controller and finally as part of the FIRST Robotics Competition where students fabricated large robots from raw materials such as steel C-sections and using the more complex National Instruments Compact RIO controller, competing nationally and internationally.
