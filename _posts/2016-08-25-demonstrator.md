Between 2012 and 2014 I spent some time working for Macquarie University and their LEAP Robotics High School program. During my time with LEAP Robotics I was involved in attending schools in the greater Sydney area to teach the students all about engineering principles and software programming but deeper than that we strived to show them that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) can be interesting and aimed to impart related skills like confidence and leadership.

We did this through a number of mediums: firstly with Lego Mindstorms products to teach the basics of programming and robotics, secondly as part of the FIRST Tech Challenge a competition where students build small robots primarily with mechano-like products and the Lego NXT controller and finally as part of the FIRST Robotics Competition where students fabricated large robots from raw materials such as steel C-sections and using the more complex National Instruments Compact RIO controller, competing nationally and internationally.
